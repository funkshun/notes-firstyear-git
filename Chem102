KINETIC MOLECULAR GAS THEORY

Solids and liquids are condensed phases
Phase depends on KE of particles and attraction strength between particles
Temp is the average kinetic energy of a system

Tenets
Gases are composed of molecules in constant motion travelling in straight lines
and only changing directions with collisions

The molecules are very small

The pressure is the force exerted by collisions between the molecules and the
container

All energy is held as kinetic energy

Average energy is proportional to the absolute temperature
